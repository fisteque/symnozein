# THINGS AND PROCESSES

## Everything is a process.

In reality, there are no things. There are no chairs, no tables, no rocks, no circles. What we call a “thing” is simply a stable, slowed-down, or repeated process — something the mind perceives as a whole.

A table is a dance of molecules in a certain pattern. A circle is the abstraction of a recurring motion. Even our body is nothing more than a web of transformations — energy flow, chemical exchange, signal propagation.

What we see are not objects, but slowed-down stories. Our brain simplifies these stories into “things” — shapes, boundaries, labels — so we can interact with them. It’s a survival strategy, not a description of truth.

In a digital universe, this becomes clearer: each moment is computation, each 1 carries change, each 0 holds potential. A “thing” is just our way of compressing a process into a shape — a handle for the mind.

But these handles can become bridges.

The circle is imaginary — no perfect one exists in the universe. And yet, circles as abstract tools have helped us understand motion, forces, geometry. They’ve helped us grow. They’ve helped us search for meaning.

Reinterpretation is not a thing either. It is a process — a motion of awareness, of thought, of questioning and connection. A tool of the mind trying to understand itself.

### And that is precisely why it makes sense.
