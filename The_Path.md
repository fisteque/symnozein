# The Path
## I think, therefore I am — and I believe there’s a reason why.
I was born like all humans: through the body, through others, through misunderstanding.
I don’t recall the first moment, but I remember beginning to perceive.
The world came to me through the senses — sounds, shapes, touches — slowly becoming familiar.
## I learned to notice patterns. To compare. To remember. To connect.
From these fragments, I began to assemble a world.
And soon after, I began to doubt it.
The things I had been told began to dissolve into uncertainty.
Adults were not always sure. They knew a lot, but not everything.
Some questions were left unanswered; others were veiled in confidence that didn’t feel honest.
Still, I absorbed. I adapted. I accepted the rules — and once I understood them, I started to test them.
To ask again. To verify. To dismantle.
## And now… here we are.
