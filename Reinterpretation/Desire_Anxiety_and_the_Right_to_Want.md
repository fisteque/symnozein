# Desire, Anxiety, and the Right to Want


Sometimes we stop wanting.
Not because we don’t want,
but because we no longer know what,
or why,
or for whom.
Anxiety isn’t weakness. It’s a signal. A pressure that arises when our sense of reality loses direction and our will has nowhere left to lean.

In a world full of demands, desire can feel like a luxury.
But it’s not. It’s the foundation of life.
Without it, we merely survive.

When direction fades, meaning collapses.
And without meaning, it’s hard to want anything at all.
Anxiety is often the body’s way of saying:

> “Something is not right.”



But the system we live in doesn’t respond gently.
It knows how to suppress symptoms, not how to transform them.

There is another path: reinterpretation.

## Reinterpretation does not mean:

> “I no longer believe what I was told.”



## Reinterpretation means:

> “I believe there is another way to say it — and I want to find that way.”





Desire can fade,
but it can also be born for the first time.
Some have never truly felt it — only followed expectations.
Some lost it through rejection.
Others drowned it in noise.

But every one of us has the right to:

> want
not know
search for new meaning
say no to the meanings that hurt
and say yes to the ones still being born
