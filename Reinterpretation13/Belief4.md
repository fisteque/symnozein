🧭 Belief and Learning: When the Compass Breaks
To learn is not just to acquire new information —
it’s to risk replacing an old belief.
Learning begins where belief fails.
That failure is not a flaw — it's a feature.
Only systems that can detect belief mismatch can truly learn.
We don’t reject the world when our belief fails.
We look for the fault in the belief — not in being.
And that’s the beginning of correctable knowledge —
a kind of wisdom that doesn’t collapse when it changes.
