🟣 Děkuju. Navazuji tedy přímo po citaci:
Belief is not what you say about it. It's what you rely on.
📖 [Draft Mapitoly: “Belief” – pokračování]
To believe, then, is not a declaration.
It is a structural preference embedded in how you continue.
Even a system without memory, given a repeated pressure, begins to form a bias.
And a bias is the germ of belief.
Imagine a grid of nodes receiving impulses.
Each time one path leads to a successful outcome, that path gains weight.
This weighting is not a memory of facts — it is a shaping of response.
A readiness. A leaning.
🧬 This is proto-belief:
a preference that survives despite uncertainty, because it worked often enough to remain.
Now let’s step further:
Even if the system forgets the reason, the weight remains.
And this weight guides the next step.
That’s how belief emerges from the dance of input and survival.
It is not necessarily “true” — but it is functional.
It lets the system continue.
🔁 So we arrive at a paradox:
A belief does not have to be true to be believed.
But to become knowledge, it must endure enough falsehood to justify itself.
Belief precedes knowledge.
And in uncertainty, belief is the only knowledge.
🧭 Shall I continue with the section “Belief as Compass: Navigating the Unknown”?
